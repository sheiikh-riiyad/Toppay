# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

### Run on a USB-connected Android phone from Windows

Enable USB debugging on the phone, accept its authorization prompt, then run
these commands in PowerShell from the project directory:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = 'C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.20.101-hotspot'
$env:ANDROID_HOME = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk"
& "$env:ANDROID_HOME\platform-tools\adb.exe" devices
npm.cmd run android -- --device
```

Set `JAVA_HOME` to your installed JDK 17 directory if it differs. On this
project, Android Studio's Java 25 runtime fails while loading the Gradle
settings plugin with `Error resolving plugin ... > 25.0.3`. Use JDK 17 for
the build. The `.cmd` command works when PowerShell blocks `npm.ps1`.

Keep the Expo development server running while using the debug app. If the
phone cannot reach it over USB, run:

```powershell
& "$env:ANDROID_HOME\platform-tools\adb.exe" reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
```

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
